Use this on any component or App.jsx file if you want.

```bash
  const [loading, error, response] = useApi(
    "http://localhost:3000/api/products/name"
  );

  if (error) {
    return <h1>Something went wrong!</h1>;
  }
  if (loading) {
    return <h1>Loading...</h1>;
  }
```

Just pass your api on the useApi hook and useApi hook will give your 3 response that are 
1. loading - it will check if api is ready or not
2. error - it will throw an error if API dosen't respond 
3. response - it will show the result/response of API


we can also handle all the responses and can customize the useApi for our own usecase scenario.
